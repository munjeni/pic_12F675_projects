Project List
-----------------------------------------
A set of projects and example code for the PIC 12F675 8-pin 8-bit Microcontroller,
in C and Assembly.
Each Project/example has a short Readme.md , eagle schematic image and source code file
in the relevant sub-folder. All projects in C code unless stated that they are written in 
Assembly.
